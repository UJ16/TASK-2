### Objective
To create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius,
Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program should allow the user to
input a temperature in one scale and output the converted
temperature in another scale.


### Key Activities
- **Understanding the problem:** The the necessary formulas for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin are need to be known.
- **Program designing:** Planning the structure of the program and identifying the functions needed for each conversion is done.
- **Implementation:** The prototypes are defined.The logic for reading user input, performing conversions, and displaying the results are implemented.
- **Testing and Debugging:** Proper testing of the program is done with different inputs to ensure accurate conversions. The program is debugged for any issues or incorrect calculations.
- **Optimization:** Ensuring the program is efficient and easy to understand is the most important step.


 ### Technologies used
- **C Programming language**
- **VSS Code**
